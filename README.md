# Restaurant-Revenue-Prediction

Opening new branch branch of business or company need large investments of time and capital, 
so deciding the best location and time to open them should not be bias and subjective based on personal opinion.
When the wrong location for a new branch is selected, it can be closed in few months even before the invested capital paid off. 

This study, a mathematical model is built to accurately predict the best location and time to open new site of restaurant. 
This model is expected to increase the effectiveness of investments. In the analysis, given a set of datapoints 
associated with demographic, real estate, and commercial data, the annual restaurant revenue will be predicted 
by using some machine learning methods such as Random Forest and XGBoost.

Data that is used in this study is take from kaggle, the detail about the dataset can be seen in the folowing link
